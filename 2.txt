I bought this for my phone and it looks great, nice length but the cable fits way too tight into the phone.
I have to really push hard to get it in all the way so it connects. I hope this does not create a problem with the port on the phone.
Nice braided cable. I hope the cats find it less attractive than the plastic cables.

Reviewed in the United States ???? on March 7, 2023
Size: 6footColor: GreyNumber of Items: 5Verified Purchase
Pros:
Strong outside, length, work great when they work.

Cons:
Internals are weak. I have went thru almost 10 of these cables. I have only 1 left. They do not last. Especially the ones I use for the car. I assume the moving of the cable is just too much for it to handle.

I never bend them nor do I press or squash them. Only rolled in a big circle or left laying there.

The exterior is strong as these are the only cables I've ever had that the internal wires are not showing.

I still use these chargers so I would say they are durable but maybe a little too durable. The cord does not bend. Bought these 4 months ago and they still retained the shape they were folded in when they were packaged. The device you’re charging will literally stand up because the charger is thick and hard to bend. No problem, just a little odd.

Ordered these because I needed some longer USB-C cables and I liked the color. I do like the braded material, they're definitely a little more durable than some I've ownes... or so I thought. About a month in, the cable was falling out of my devices (phone, deck, controller) and wasn't charging. Tried several different devices and cable combinations and ruled it was the cable. There is some mild wear on the connection so maybe I got a lackluster batch. Who knows.

2nd Review
~~~~~~~~~~

Further Below is my initial review. Sadly after only 3 weeks of use - these cables seem to break connection near the end of the plug - just like most cables do these days.
I guess if you plug them in then DON'T move the cellphone or whatever they're attached to, then they may last longer. Otherwise be prepared for them to have an internal break - as fast as the majority of other brands of cables. Quite disappointing to say the least.
I plan to try different brands to see if any of them are better

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1st Review Below
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most cables are so thin that the wire ends up breaking near the plug ends.
Very pleased with these cables as well as how well they're packaged prior to shipment.
They charge fast And the cables are much thicker than most which seems to prolong their lifespan.
Seem to be very good quality as opposed to most on the market.

The other two cables are fine, but most of these were/are pure duds. So you're taking risk buy buying these.

Unfortunately, these cords are worse off directly out of the package than my worn out cords that are after many moths of use. They may be ok for stationary use, but not as a phone charger. The charging cuts I. And out if I just slightly move the phone and .out often it only registers as a slow charge (5-9 hours from 30% to full). Cheap product pricewise and quality wise.

I just had to spend $120 to get a brand new charging port because these fried mine. They are incredibly cheaply made, ususal daily bending causes damage to the wires inside which will cause it to short circuit and fry your charging port. Originally I thought it just put some dust or debris on the charging port or that the cable itself was damaged since it went from taking an hour to charge to over 3 hours to charge from 40% to 80% and would frequently disconnect. Then I bought 2 other chargers from other companies and had the same issue. Chargers fresh out the box would disconnect randomly and take over 4 hours to charge. I just took my phone into a repair shop shop and they told me what happened. Don't waste your money on this, I'm just lucky it didn't brick my phone.

It did charge the hearing aids, light turned green indicating charge was complete, but the hearing aids died in the middle of the afternoon. Typically they work the whole day without going dead, so for some reason these are not compatible to his charging unit. Will probably return.

Product came quickly and as described but does not charge my phone quickly. Only about 10% battery life gained in almost an hour!

I feel that chargers is like buying a cheap used car. It is never going to last longer than a few mos. That's all I got.

2.0 out of 5 stars these simply don't maintain a reliable connection

I bought these to connect an external drive to my phone. unfortunately the connection is not solid enough for that purpose (the phone and drive are constant danger of disconnecting when using this cord)

I would not recommend

3.0 out of 5 stars Great for when you need a charger in a pinch

My original Samsung charger ended up breaking so I got these. They aren't terrible by any means (for the price at least) but I have a hard time believing they actually fast charge. My phone says it's fast charging but it takes longer than the old original fast charging cable. If you need fast charging I'd skip on these, if you just need a charging cable and no time restrictions, these will work just fine.

I had a hard time getting my phone to charge. (Samsung galaxy s20 I think) tried another cord from the pack and it worked OK. I didn't use the factory wall plug so it didn't do super fast charging. They work but mine had at least one dud in it so far.
