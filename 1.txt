Reviewed in the United States ???? on May 26, 2023
Size: 1footColor: BlackNumber of Items: 5Verified Purchase
The SMALLElectric Short USB Type-C Cable 5-pack has been an absolute lifesaver for my GoPro Hero 8 setup, and I'm thrilled to share my experience with this fantastic product. Specifically designed to fit seamlessly with the Neewer Removable Battery Cover Type-C Charging Port Adapter, these cables have exceeded my expectations in terms of compatibility and functionality.

First and foremost, these cables are the perfect size for my needs. They fit perfectly into the side slots of the Neewer adapter attached to my GoPro Hero 8 Black. This configuration allows me to charge my camera conveniently while also having the option to attach a battery pack for extended shooting sessions. The length of these 12-inch cables is just right, offering flexibility without unnecessary excess.

The packaging of the SMALLElectric cables deserves a special mention. Each cable is individually packaged in its own slot, ensuring that they arrive safely and tangle-free. This thoughtful packaging design reflects the attention to detail that the company has put into their product, and I truly appreciated it.

All five cables in the pack worked flawlessly right out of the box. I experienced no connectivity issues or charging interruptions. They deliver fast charging at 3A, enabling rapid and efficient charging for my GoPro Hero 8. Whether I'm on the go or setting up for a shoot, these cables have consistently performed at a high level.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the SMALLElectric Short USB Type-C Cable 5-pack. They have been an essential part of my GoPro Hero 8 setup, allowing me to charge my camera conveniently and power it with a battery pack when needed. The perfect fit, reliable performance, and thoughtful packaging all contribute to my positive experience with this product.

Without a doubt, I would not hesitate to purchase these cables again. They have proven their worth and have become an indispensable part of my gear arsenal. If you're in search of reliable and compatible USB Type-C cables for your GoPro Hero 8 or any other devices, I highly recommend giving the SMALLElectric Short USB Type-C Cable 5-pack a try.

Love these, will buy more as I lose and/or maim them. I'm that chaotic friend who has destroyed every cord known to man, or lost them! These are still with me and still working great. The cording around the cord also deters my kitties from eating the spicy wires, too.

I got these to charge all my VR equipment instead of juggling around the few cables that I had.

These charge my gear QUICK within an hour off the same outlet. I used the little twist ties they came with to keep the 4 cords wrapped together to keep things organized and with no cord mess. They also are thick and braided to prevent my cats from chewing on them!

If you want a good C-type cable, then look no further. Length should not be a problem unless you need something to where you can walk around the room while on your smartphone.

Quality of the cable and connectors was fine. Shame I had to move the little Velcro straps from another manufacturer to the new connectors so I could coil up the cable. As I said nearly there.
